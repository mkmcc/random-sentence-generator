This is my solution to the CS107 "random sentence generator" homework
problem.  It parses a context-free grammar file to generate random,
"madlib" style output.  Output should be grammatically correct, but
gibberish.

I shamelessly stole the grammar definitions from here:
[[https://github.com/onedayitwillmake/Stanford-CS-107/tree/master/Programming%20Assigments/01%20-%20RSG/Solution/assn-1-rsg/data]]

Run "./parse-rsg.el" to convert the supplied ".g" grammar files into
an elisp-compatible format.

Then run, eg, "./rsg.el data/bond.el" to get an output like:

A demented industrialist attempts to start world war 3 by wrecking the
global economy. Bond meets his foe for the first time and they exhange
veiled threats. During this time, Bond meets a gorgeous mistress of
the Bad Guy, whom he marries. Soon thereafter, Bond is overwhelmed by
an army of terrorists and dropped out of an airplane. After some
spectacular violence, he escapes by using his Bat Gas. Finally, with
only 007 seconds to spare, Bond defuses the bomb with his bare hands.

or "./rsg/kant.el":

To avoid all misapprehension, it is necessary to explain that, on the
contrary, the thing in itself (and it must not be supposed that this
is true), has lying before it our hypothetical judgements. I assert
that our faculties are the clue to the discovery of so regarded,
time. Our ideas, as I have elsewhere shown, would be falsified. We can
deduce that, in so far as this expounds the practical rules of time,
the discipline of human reason (and I assert that this is true), is
the key to understanding the practical employment of applied logic.


Enjoy!
